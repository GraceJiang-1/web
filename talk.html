  <h2> 
    Origin Of MUJI
    {
    color: blue

  </h2>
    <p>
      MUJI in Japanese is Mujirushi Ryohin which translates to "no-brand quality goods" . MUJI, originally founded in 1980 in Japan, offers consumers a wide variety of products including Stationary, Household Goods, Apparel, and Food.
      Muji is based on its 3 core principles:
      <li> 1. Selection of materials </li> 
      <li> 2. Streamlining of processes </li>
      <li> 3. Simplification of packages </li> 
      <br>
      MUJI isn't in the range of minimalist style rather it is more of a concise style. MUJIs origin comes from a process of trying to create simple, low-cost, good quality products. MUJI's goal is to be able to provide consumers with a rational satisfaction, expressed with a "this will do" rather than a "this is what I really want". By doing so, MUJI aims to be something that is enough and not something that you really want. MUJI's ideas for their products is not for their products to scream MUJI. The idea itself is the product and MUJI delivers it to their coonsumers. MUJI aims to live up to everyone's expectations.
