  <h2> 
    Origin Of MUJI
  </h2>
  <br>
    <p>
      MUJI in Japanese is Mujirushi Ryohin which translates to "no-brand quality goods" . MUJI, originally founded in 1980 in Japan, offers consumers a wide variety of products including stationary, household goods, apparel, and food.
      Muji is based on its 3 core principles:
      <li> 1. Selection of materials </li> 
      <li> 2. Streamlining of processes </li>
      <li> 3. Simplification of packages </li> 
      MUJI isn't in the range of minimalist style rather it is more of a concise style. MUJIs origin was "a thorough rationalization of the manufacturing process with an eye to creating simple, low-cost, good quality products."
